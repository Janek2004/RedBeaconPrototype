TableView With Sections that when selected: || -Orders -Help -User Actions
It will be solved with CollectionView


Orders:
There are updated from the server. Pretty cool.
So it looks like the tables are created on the flow. Probably from JSON File.
    
    Create New Order
        Search
        Drill Down Orders
        Add Media
        Media Controller (adding media) with tab bar overlay.
        Add Location - Location Manager
        Anything Else? (notes)
        At the end send json file with user preferences to the server.
        
        How to save user's choices....?
        By taking nodes from json received from the server, selecting the answers
        
        [userAnswer setValue:childNodeIndexString forKey:@"id"];
        [userAnswer setValue:question forKey:@"question"];
        [userAnswer setValue:answer forKey:@"answer" ];

Search View Controller
Search  
        search 
        -> Without typing anything default categories are returned
        -> After typing the result in, json will be returned.
        -> Also taping on the scroll view results in sending query
            
            The result will be an array of the nodes in the following format:
            "parentid":"index", "id":"index", "title":"Title","options":[{"name":"Home","childNodeId":""},...]
            In this way the table can drill down like described in Create New Orders

            Probably we need to disable the default popover behavior, so it won't disappear when people 
            It can be done using either delegate or: self.myPopovercontroller.passthroughViews=[NSArray arrayWithObject:self.view];

Container View Controllers in Drill Down
    



Queries should be sent from the singleton that will be located in BeaconManager

Singleton will contain:
- logging in and out
    - facebook
    - regular login
- sending queries
- some constants like cellids and urls
- responsible for notifications
- displaying network activity notification +
- responsible for keeping track of user's order


Optional
Access to core data?

Help
How it works
That could be either:
circular collection view
    or
scroll view (boring! but works...)


FAQ
    http://www.redbeacon.com/about/faq/#1
    I am not really sure what's the url of the website used in redbeacon app.
    

Video
Code for displaying google video. Nothing fency, it's just htmlstring from the YouTube sharing code.

- (void) displayGoogleVideo
{
    CGRect rect = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds];
    CGSize screenSize = rect.size;
   
    UIWebView *webView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,screenSize.width,screenSize.height)];
    webView.autoresizesSubviews = YES;
    webView.autoresizingMask=(UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth);
   
    NSString *videoUrl = @"http://www.youtube.com/v/oHg5SJYRHA0";

    NSString *htmlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"<html><head><meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"initial-scale = 1.0, user-scalable = no, width = 212\"/></head><body style=\"background:#F00;margin-top:0px;margin-left:0px\"><div><object width=\"320\" height=\"480\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"%@\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"%@\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\"></embed></object></div></body></html>",videoUrl,videoUrl]    ;

    [webView loadHTMLString:htmlString baseURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.youtube.com"]];
   
    [window addSubview:webView];
    [webView release]; // CLANG BUG FIXED
}



On the bottom scroll view or collection view with custom 3D layout
And big red button with sign New Request.


Somewhere in the app there should be a class that is checking the network connectivity.

Also it should have notification system implemented.

//Where are we saving it?
// Probably we can build json on the flow with all information necessary.
//We need to think about format of the cells
//So for example:
//Apparantly there is no way of saving drafts. It would be nice to have this function
//but it makes it easier without it.

Editing.
Can you edit former request?
Only a text. Good. An you can add voice recording as well. Pefect.
